##### Relevant comments:

I tried to mix as many different ways of implementing the same thing as possible. This was done with images, SCSS rules, and ways to implement and inject components into each other.

I also tried to use animations and other details to show knowledge.

I didn't have much time to work with great care and detail on the project. It could have optimized the reuse of CSS more as well as componentized more things and even cleaned up unused code. I am very busy, I have very little free time and I also have other tests/challenges requested by other selection processes. including with regard to gitflow.

I apologize for that. In my normal job I'm much more of a perfectionist than that.
