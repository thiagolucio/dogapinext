##### Relevant comments:

To demonstrate more knowledge I created my own API (json-server) based on the items requested in the test in relation to the original API.

I used NextJS as a solution to speed up my work but I didn't use any visual libraries and created the css code in a pure and personal way.

I implemented loading as requested. But due to the API being local it will not appear. To see the loading. Please go to the page "src/pages/list.js", on line 36, and add "!" at the beginning as in the image below and the loading can be seen.

I tried to mix as many different ways of implementing the same thing as possible. This was done with images, SCSS rules, and ways to implement and inject components into each other.

I also tried to use animations and other details to show knowledge.

I didn't have much time to work with great care and detail on the project. It could have optimized the reuse of CSS more as well as componentized more things and even cleaned up unused code. I am very busy, I have very little free time and I also have other tests/challenges requested by other selection processes. including with regard to gitflow.

I apologize for that. In my normal job I'm much more of a perfectionist than that.
